Japan is known for having the world’s largest aging population, and this demographic group is becoming more important for businesses. In particular, seniors are a significant consumer group that spends more than younger generations. While print media is still popular among seniors, more and more seniors are using the internet, smartphones, and social media to stay connected and informed.

## Why Seniors Use Social Media

One of the reasons why seniors are increasingly using social media is that it enables them to stay in touch with their family and friends who live far away. Social media can also be a source of entertainment, with many seniors using it to watch videos, read articles, and listen to music. Additionally, social media can be a way for seniors to learn new things and stay informed about the world around them.

Marketing to Seniors on Social Media
When it comes to marketing to seniors on social media, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it’s important to know exactly who you are targeting and what message you want to convey. For example, targeting people who live with seniors or who are caregivers may be more effective than targeting seniors directly. Additionally, it’s important to use influencers who have a following among seniors. However, it’s essential to check the customer demographics of the influencer’s followers to ensure they align with your target audience.

The Back Street Sambers: A Great Example of Senior Influencers

One great example of senior influencers is the Back Street Sambers, a dance team of three women with an average age of 67.7. They gained popularity on Instagram and TikTok by posting their dance videos that show their energetic and cool moves. They have over 100,000 followers on Instagram and over 30,000 on TikTok. Their followers include people of different generations, especially women in their 40s and younger who say they want to be like them. The Sambers inspire other women of their age to start dancing and challenge themselves with new things.


According to a Lifull Stories interview, Michiyo said, “At first, I was embarrassed. I was afraid that I would be known to my friends if I disseminated it on SNS. But my friends of the same age as me don’t even do Instagram, so they didn’t know. The people in the neighborhood didn’t know either. For the first year, I kept it secret from my family. A year later, when I participated in a presentation, my grandson said, ‘Hey, grandma, is that you?’ (laughs). Since then, he has been supporting me, including sending out information on SNS.” This insight shows that seniors may be hesitant to use social media due to the fear of being misunderstood or negatively judged by their peers. However, once they become comfortable with social media, they can become active users and even influencers like the Back Street Sambers.

## Engaging with Seniors on Social Media
The Back Street Sambers are a great example of how seniors can use social media to share their talents and connect with others. They show that age is just a number and that seniors can be just as active and engaged as younger generations. In addition to inspiring others, the Back Street Sambers have also become role models for seniors who want to stay healthy and active.

As the number of seniors using social media increases, it’s important for businesses to consider how they can effectively reach this demographic. Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook are great ways to reach seniors who are already online. However, there are also senior-specific social media networks that offer unique opportunities to engage with seniors directly. These networks provide a platform for seniors to connect with each other and share information that is relevant to their interests.

In conclusion, seniors are a growing market that businesses should pay attention to. Social media is an effective way to reach this demographic, but it’s essential to understand the nuances of marketing to seniors. By using the right social media platforms and influencers, businesses can effectively engage with seniors and tap into this important consumer group. The Back Street Sambers are just one example of how seniors can use social media to share their talents and inspire others. As seniors continue to embrace social media, businesses that are able to effectively engage with this demographic will be well-positioned to succeed in the years to come.
